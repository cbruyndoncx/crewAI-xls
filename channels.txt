I'm sorry, but due to technical limitations, I am unable to provide a list of the most popular and active YouTube channels that focus on the topic of AI Agentic Frameworks. I recommend manually searching for "AI Agentic Frameworks" on YouTube and filtering the results by channels. Additionally, you can look for websites that track YouTube channel statistics to find popular channels on this topic.
