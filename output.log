The fifth website also does not provide any information due to a connection error. I have exhausted all the website sources I had for information on the AI landscape in Belgium. 

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: 
I'm sorry, but I was unable to find detailed information on the AI landscape in Belgium. The websites I tried either had pages that were not found or had connection issues. The only information I was able to gather is from AI4Belgium, a community that brings together AI key-players from public sector, private sector, academia and civil society in Belgium. However, it does not provide specific information on the major players in the AI landscape in Belgium.[0m
