Shall We Get The Rods Out? Fishing Blog The answer is always yes! I set up get the rods out to share my love of fishing through fishing blogs and fishing holiday guides. I‚Äôve been fishing for over 20 years and have fished everything from the sea around the northwest of England to carp fishing across the country and abroad. If it swims in water ‚Äì I‚Äôll try and catch it! Find local lakes, rivers and canals you can fish too.¬†

I‚Äôm always adding more blogs to the site, from tips and holiday destinations to blogs about recent sessions I‚Äôve had. Here is a guide to all the content you will find on my fishing blog.¬† 
Carp Fishing GuidesCarp fishing is my favoured type of fishing and it's what I spend most of my time doing. I've been carp fishing for over 20 years. I've run a private lake for 7 years and run my own bait company for 4 years. I setup this site to share my tips and get more people into carp fishing.

Read My Fishing Lakes Guides
Caravan Parks With LakesA number of the UK's caravan parks have fishing lakes on site with a mix of coarse or carp fishing. We've hunted round to find them and get the key fishing information for each site. Find your next caravan break, some have fishing right in front of your caravan!

Perch FishingIn the winter I like to get out and fish for Perch, as well as pike. Short-session perch fishing is great fun and I always keep moving which is great when it's cold. Perch will still happily feed regardless of how cold the water is, it's just a case if finding them! 
Read My Perch Fishing Tips
Pike FishingAs well as perch fishing I also like to do some piking in the winter. A couple of the lakes I regularly fish allow 3 rods over the winter so I keep 2 for carp and dead bait for pike with the third rod. If you get the right conditions pike fishing can be great.

Reviews from our customers
Ritchie
 - Carp fishing at Jonchery 7 & 8, Northern France
Peg 7 is perfect for 2/3 people which is stocked very well, we had 82 carp upto 53lb and average size was 26lb. The lake pellet, maize mix and boilies are a must and listen to Mark the bailiff, Simple rigs and bottom baits work best. It's very peacefull lake and facilities are very good, with plenty of freezer space

What months are best for carp fishing in France?
Although you can go carp fishing in France all year round, some months are better than others. But as general rule of thumb carp like mild water temperatures: they won't bit if it's too cold or too warm. Late March, April to mid-May are great months until the carp start spawning. It's hard to predict when the carp will start to spawn because this depends entirely from the water temperature. The summer is also good, but carp don't like extremely hot weather. In September, October and November the water temperature starts to drop and this is when carp feed heavily to prepare for winter time.
You will of course catch carp at other times of the year. Lakes located in southern France with mild temperatures will also fish well during winter.Can you fish in France without a license?
If you fish on a public lake you need a fishing license. But you don't need a fishing license if you fish on a private venue. Most of our venues are private, so you don't have to worry about a fishing permit. Vaulaurent is our only lake where a license is required but the lake owner will take care of your license (included in the price)
Want to fish on a public water? You can buy your fishing license at local sporting goods stores, caf√©s or tourist offices. The approximate costs are: one-day permit--10 euros, for one year--60 euros. Children pay less.

[32;1m[1;3mThought: 
The co-worker provided a website that contains information about various carp fishing lakes in France, but not specifically in the Benelux region. However, this website could be a starting point to identify the major players in the carp fishing lakes for rent business. I will use this information to provide a SWOT analysis.

Final Answer: 
Based on the information available, here is a tentative SWOT analysis for the carp fishing lakes for rent in the Benelux region:

Strengths:
- Variety of lakes: The website lists a variety of lakes, indicating a diverse range of options for customers.
- Customer reviews: The presence of customer reviews suggests a level of transparency and customer engagement.

Weaknesses:
- Limited information: The website does not provide specific information about the lakes in the Benelux region.
- Potential language barrier: The website is in English, which may not be accessible to all potential customers in the Benelux region.

Opportunities:
- Expansion: If the website already covers lakes in France, there could be opportunities to expand to the Benelux region.
- Partnerships: Potential for partnerships with local businesses or tourism boards in the Benelux region to promote the lakes.

Threats:
- Competition: There may be local competitors in the Benelux region that are not listed on the website.
- Regulatory issues: There may be local regulations or environmental concerns that could impact the business.

Please note that this analysis is based on limited information and may not fully represent the actual situation. Further research is needed to provide a more accurate and comprehensive SWOT analysis.[0m
