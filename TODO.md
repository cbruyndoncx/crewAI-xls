# TODO List

## General Recommendations

- **Error Handling**: 
  - Add error handling to file operations, user inputs, and dynamic imports to improve robustness.
  - Use `try-except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
  - Validate inputs to ensure they meet expected criteria before processing.
  - Use assertions to enforce conditions that should always be true.
  - Log errors and exceptions for later analysis.
  - Provide fallback mechanisms or default values when an error occurs.
  - Ensure resources are properly released using `finally`.
  - Define custom exceptions for specific error conditions.

- **Logging**: 
  - Ensure that logging is comprehensive and provides enough detail for debugging.

- **Security**: 
  - Ensure that sensitive information, such as OAuth credentials, is securely managed.

- **Testing**: 
  - Consider adding unit tests for critical functions to ensure reliability.
